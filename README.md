# Bayesian-Variable-Selection-and-Model-Averaging-for-Predicting-Student-Performance

Using a dataset of 1,000 students, I moved beyond traditional single-model approaches to employ Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and variable selection. This powerful framework allowed me to account for model uncertainty and provide a robust, probabilistic ranking of which factors truly impact exam scores.

üîë Key Findings:
The results were clear and actionable:

‚úÖ Study Hours is the strongest positive predictor.

‚úÖ Mental Health & Well-being is a critical, often underestimated, contributor to success.

‚úÖ Sleep & Exercise have significant positive impacts.

‚ùå Social Media & Netflix Hours show a strong negative correlation with performance.

‚ûñ Demographic factors like age, gender, and parental education had negligible effects when accounting for habits.

This isn't just an academic exercise. These insights can help students make better time-management decisions, guide educators in developing targeted support programs, and assist universities in allocating resources effectively towards high-impact areas like mental health and study skills workshops.

I performed the entire analysis in R, using packages like BAS, and progressed from simple linear models to a full Bayesian workflow, including model checking and validation.
